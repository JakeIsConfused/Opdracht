                <h2 class="lore"> Story of For Honor</h2>
                <p>The story of For Honor is set in a fictional region called
                    Heathmoor where 4 of the 5 factions fight in battle</p>
                    <p>Heathmoor is a mix of multiple ecosystems,
                        but primarily is one of three kinds of climates: temperate in the Southwest,
                        tundra in the North and wetlands in the Southeast. The Northeast part of Heathmoor
                        stems out into an ocean, with either a strait or canal cutting through the
                        Valkenheim region towards the West.</p>

                    Factions
                </h2>
                <p> In het spel For honor zijn er Factions die tegen elkaar strijden ze bestaan genaamelijk uit meerdere
                    clasesses in een faction:</p>
                <div class="factions">
                    <div>
                        <h3>
                            Knight
                        </h3>
                        <div class="symbol">
                            <img src="css/images/Knight_Symbol.png"width="180px" height="240px" alt="">
                        </div>
                            <p>
                                For Knights, honor and duty go hand-in-hand. 
                                Oaths were not lightly broken and many knights
                                 serve warlords they do not look highly upon.
                                  Honor was not tied to imprisonment as doing 
                                  so was considered an act of mercy
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>
                            Samurai
                        </h3>

                        </div>
                        <p>Honor is highly valued amongst the Samurai. They are loyal to death,
                             battling to defend those they have been sworn 
                             to even in hopeless situations, and vowing vengeance should their
                              master be slain. Pride, ambition, and honor seem to be linked
                               as demotion is seen as dishonor to the point the act of jailing
                                a person is considered a grievous insult.</p>

                        <p>For Vikings, honor is tied to reputation. Bravery, nobility, magnanimity,
                             a sense of fair play, respect for others, and the strength to do what
                              is right is praised. Acts of cowardice and treachery are reviled. Freedom is highly 
                              valued and the act of taking someone prisoner is to make them your slave

                        <p>When the Cataclysm hit, China was not prepared for the civil war that would break out.
                             Even when a ruler was established under a prestigious dynasty, kingdoms
                              would fall from unrest and rebellions. As a result of all this conflict and misery,
                               a number of warriors have chosen to venture West, finding themselves in Heathmoore.
                                Whether or not they will find peace or a resolution in this new land is left up to
                                 question, but they have chosen to join the faction war as the foreign fourth group of
                                  miscellaneous warriors.
